1. To install vue with Laravel-npm install vue 
2.How Vue Js works in Laravel
User visits Home page->It loads web.php file->calls method of a controller->Method returns json data
3. For returning a method we must write 
  public function newmethod(){
        return response()->json([
               'msg'=>'We must return only json'
        ]);
    }
4.Instead of redirecting to 404 page if we want that while our routes does not match to return it to any specific page we should type
Route::any('{slug}',function(){
return view('welcome');
});
Relevant incase of SPA
Whole process
1. Users visits website 
2. It loads web.php 
3. Calls method of a controller
4.Method returns Json data
If no match found
5. if then use spa route which is known as any route in Laravel 
6.A route then calls a Controllers method 
7.Method returns a view lers assume its welcome.blade.php
8. In welcome.blade.php we return Vue js component
9. The vue js components returns Vue routers
10.The vue router tries to find a match for testpage route
11.Vue router than loads a Vue element

Another workprocess
js/app.js
Enry point starts from resources resources/js/app.js
require('./bootstrap');

window.Vue=require("vue");


Vue.component('mainapp',require('./components/mainapp.vue').default)
const app=new Vue({
    el:'#app',
})

Loads vue,routes,stores everything related to Vue
All vue files are useless with webpack.mix.js it becomes useful
We have to copile everything in app.js mainapp.vue need to convert al into plain JS
Go to Webpack.mix.js
It says inside webpack.mix.js take all code and put it inside public folder
Takes all files from resources.js and put it inside public folder
For that write we need to run npm run dev 
Browser only understands plain JS code.It will take and compile everything in plain JS.

public app.js is teh whole Vue JS project
